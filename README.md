Willow is a Web Interaction Library that eases the burden of creating AJAX-based web applications.

It's built on top of the [Seaside](https://github.com/SeasideSt/Seaside) Web Framework providing a set of composable components and easier AJAX interaction.

It is based on the work first presented in the [Smalltalks 2013 Conference](http://fast.org.ar/talks/objects-and-messages-for-user-interaction) . 
A video of the presentation can be seen [here](https://youtu.be/JezITRHCBuc?list=PLCGAAdUizzH027lLWKXh_44cGuEsay7-R) .
