Willow is a Web Interaction Library that eases the burden of creating responsive web applications. 

It is based on the work first presented in the [Smalltalks 2013 Conference](http://fast.org.ar/talks/objects-and-messages-for-user-interaction) .

A video of the presentation can be seen [here](https://youtu.be/JezITRHCBuc?list=PLCGAAdUizzH027lLWKXh_44cGuEsay7-R) .
