I'm a drop-down list that allows the user to choose one value from a list. 

When a drop-down list is inactive, it displays a single value. When activated, it displays (drops down) a list of values, from which the user may select one. When the user selects a new value, the control reverts to its inactive state, displaying the selected value.

I implement the Single Selection API
